## A simple, specific tool for a simple, specific problem.

### Purpose
This tool solves one specific problem I have encountered in my personal endeavors:
- I have a large amount of folders containing various files
- I need all of these files to be moved into one directory, then delete the leftover empty folders
- *How do I do that without spending hours manually moving files and deleting folders?*
